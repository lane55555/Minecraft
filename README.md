# Minecraft Tweaks
I will continue to update this page to share my files with you. I have only added the 'src' folder because it holds all the contents I have edited/added personally. I also included a LICENSE.txt file, a .mp4 file with gameplay of my mod, and a .jar file of my mod.

****Any comments in my code marked with (Automatic) means the code next to it (or directly below it), is in the file by default and I did not write it****

(The folder that holds all the custom recipes)
Item recipes are found in:
src/main/resources/data/minecrafttweaks/recipes/

(The folder that holds all the pngs for the items)
Item pngs are found in:

(lets the game know what png to use for what item)

(The base code of the entire mod)
The main Java class is found in:

The main item code is found in:
